# Trouble

Unable to generate assets to build and debug. OmniSharp server is not running

*    Step one open Visual Studio Code
*   Go to explorer or (Ctrl+Shift+E) to get there
*    Open your folder that you created that you try to get Omnisharp into
*    click on C# Program.cs, It should be the last one
*    Then go to View (U can skip this step if u going to (Ctrl+Shift+P))
*    Select Command Pattele or (Ctrl+Shift+P)
*    From there it should bring up a Search bar
*    Search for OmniSharp
*    Select "OmniSharp: Restart Omnisharp"
*    Then wait for it to restart or agree to it to restart then wait
*    Now then if u try to add what u going to add it should work :)
